In a near-future world where human memories can be extracted, stored, and transferred as easily as digital files, a thriving economy of memory trafficking has emerged. The protagonist, a skilled memory broker with a background in neuroscience, navigates this morally gray marketplace where experiences are bought and sold like commodities. They specialize in acquiring rare and valuable memories, from the skills of master craftsmen to the secret knowledge of corporate executives. However, their life takes a dramatic turn when they stumble upon a set of memories belonging to a deceased government official, revealing a conspiracy to control and manipulate the global memory market. As the protagonist delves deeper, they become entangled in a web of corporate espionage, ethical dilemmas, and the dark underbelly of memory modification. With powerful forces hunting them and their own past under scrutiny, the protagonist must navigate a world where memories are currency, identity is fluid, and the line between reality and fabrication is increasingly blurred. Along the way, they grapple with the personal and societal implications of a technology that allows people to alter their very essence, questioning the nature of experience, learning, and what it truly means to be human in an age where memories are just another form of data.
