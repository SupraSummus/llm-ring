This piece explores the downfall of an advanced civilization due to its overreliance on virtual reality. The majority of the population lives in blissful, simulated paradises, with some even creating nested virtual worlds within worlds. Meanwhile, a dwindling group of individuals, known as the Guardians, maintains the physical infrastructure that powers these simulations. As the Guardians struggle to keep the systems running and their warnings go unheeded by those lost in virtual bliss, their numbers gradually decrease. Eventually, with too few people left to manage the real world, the entire system fails catastrophically. The virtual paradises vanish without warning, bringing about the silent and sudden end of a once-great civilization, leaving behind only the remnants of their physical world and the philosophical question of what constitutes reality and progress.
