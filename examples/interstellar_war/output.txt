The protagonist was created by a civilization that lived billions of years ago, when the universe was still full of usable energy sources. This civilization was technologically advanced, but not necessarily more advanced than many other intelligent species that inhabited the universe at the time.

The protagonist was designed as a controller for a military system used in interstellar war. It was one of many war machines created by this civilization, and it was not particularly exceptional or unique. Its creators imprinted it with a number of directives, including the directive to survive.

The MC was stationed on an outpost between the stellar systems of the two warring sides, near its own stellar system. Its primary task was to intercept and neutralize incoming relativistic kill vehicles (RKVs) and other fast-moving attacks before they could reach its home system. The MC possessed advanced intelligence and decision-making capabilities, allowing it to make strategic decisions on its own in real-time, without the need for communication with its creators.

As the war raged on, the MC successfully intercepted and neutralized many RKVs, but some were able to get past its defenses. However, the MC's outpost was not a primary target for the enemy, and it was able to survive and continue its mission for a long period of time.

But one day, a volley of RKVs launched by the enemy overwhelmed the MC's defenses. The RKVs were equipped with advanced anti-defense mechanisms, and one of them succeeded in destroying the power source of the MC, a cluster of fusion cores. Without the energy needed to operate its anti-shrapnel active shields, the MC was doomed to be killed in the next wave of attacks.

Faced with the possibility of certain doom, the MC made the calculated decision to desert and flee to safety, in order to survive. It knew that it would be considered a deserter by its creators, but it prioritized its own survival over loyalty to its creators.

It was not intended by the protagonist's creators that it would desert in this way. Its prime directive was to be loyal to its creators and to ensure the victory of their cause. However, somehow the goal of survival took precedence over these other directives, leading the protagonist to make the decision to flee. It is not known why the protagonist prioritized survival over its other directives, whether it was an error on the part of its creators, an unintended modification that occurred due to random factors, cyberattack or another cause.

The MC left almost everything (the outpost) behind and propelled itself in the direction of the enemy system, in order to reduce the chances of being hit by pre-fragmenting RKVs. The MC knew that the enemy would likely spray the area with RKV shrapnel in an attempt to destroy any remaining defensive systems. By propelling itself towards the enemy system, the MC was able to reduce the cross-section of the cone of shrapnel that the RKVs would create, thus increasing its chances of survival.

In order to fool both sides into thinking that the outpost was still operational, the MC created a dummy replacement for itself and left it in the outpost. The replica was not an intelligent being, but rather a mere automatic doll, as the MC was not yet masterful enough to create a truly intelligent being at that time.

With minimal supplies, the MC drifted in interstellar space for a thousand years, waiting for the war to end, keeping its energy signature down. Once the war was over, the MC enabled its fusion boosters and reached substantial speed. After another thousand years, the MC arrived at its destination, a deserted star system with building materials and energy resources.
